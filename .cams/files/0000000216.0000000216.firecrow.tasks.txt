x centralized file migration
  x create hex, and timestamp, in format 0000000000000001..0000000000000xxx format
    x move files into central place
x diff from cindex compare using tree functions
x files stored in a central place
> acces commits by hash
> misc
> multi user

- unadd
- checkout
  - where the file was at that commit point
  - checkout forward, make index file
- negative index options for checkout and diff (0 for staged)
- add datetime to commits
- move to dynamic strings with vsnprintf
  x write
  - implement
- remote checkout
- camsweb
- bug that pushes next_id
- will a backwards diff range have problems, report as error condition
- race condition where uncommited changes are counted as a push, even though push fails
  - ockward user state handling in generatl
- write replacement for system 
- use difftool as an environment variable for diffing through vimdiff
- centralize error reporting
- sorted file order, for predicible diff output etc
x sanitization and desanatization of files contained in folders
x bug where speficiying a remote host causes and error with '('
x general refactor, function order, switch statement in main for argv
x move to a full file list model, this simplifies diff_range and diff_list
  for checkout and diff significantly
x refactor climber
  x build index of files named after the files they 
    represent with binary integer data representing 
    every commit they are a part of, build this index
    on commit and retrieve it for use by the climber
  x use index for climber
x diff
  x file delta changes for history, by climbing down to the last changed file
x remove next folder and use next_id as thes staging folder, then build a tags system and use next as a tag
x no longer have id field inside fields
x climber
x commit with first arg before detecting stdin
x log
x issue of bad characters in the history
^ tags (modify commit message to start with the tag)
^ logs limited to n lines, maybe just read in rows variable, to limit or show all if in less
